## finbalanced

finbalanced is an online platform that improves the financial well-being of employees through financial knowledge building, practical tools and direct coaching by independent experts.

Physical, mental and financial well-being are directly and closely related. Money worries are already the number one factor for stress today (ahead of health, career and family). Financial fears and worries can be actively reduced through knowledge building, attitudinal and behavioral changes, despite unchanging conditions. Financially healthy employees are happier, less sick and less likely to change jobs. Financial anxiety cannot be hidden during working hours and prevents employees from performing at their best. Financially stressed employees cost about 11% of their annual wage bill.
